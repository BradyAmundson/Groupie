---------
Nice work on this assignment.

Good analysis of the ClassyDraw application parts!

Interesting to have a "Line" class in your inheritance diagram.  Don't all
your other subclasses have a line in them?  I guess a line IS a shape so it
can inherit from your "Shape" class independently.

One thing to note on class diagrams, technically, you don't put lines across
the box for EVERYTHING.  It should look more like this, with just lines to
divide the class name, all fields, and all functions:

      THIS:                          NOT THIS:
           +-------------------+              +-------------------+
           |     ClassName     |              |     ClassName     |
           +-------------------+              +-------------------+
           |  Class Field      |              |  Class Field      |
           |  Class Field      |              +-------------------+
           |  Class Field      |              |  Class Field      |
           |                   |              +-------------------+
           +-------------------+              |  Class Field      |
           |  Class Function   |              +-------------------+
           |  Class Function   |              |  Class Function   |
           |  Class Function   |              +-------------------+
           |                   |              |  Class Function   |
           +-------------------+              +-------------------+
                                              |  Class Function   |
                                              |                   |
Good job ~ keep up the good work!             +-------------------+
