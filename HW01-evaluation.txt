Comments:
---------
problem 2.5 is not just about documentation, it's about comments in the code
   as well; be careful about saying "too much documentation" because there
   will be times when what YOU think is too much is what is demanded by your
   company or the customer.  Don't be afraid to question it, but be prepared
   to do it anyhow and do your best work on it.

problem 4.2 the critical path is G -> D -> E -> M -> Q for a total of 32 days

problem 4.4 the schedule starts on WEDNESDAY January 1st not Monday.  Also,
   you didn't skip the holidays that were listed in the problem.  Developers
   will be unhappy!

problem 5.3 although a good case could be made for your selections, actually
   the options should be categorized as:
      User: b, c, d, l, m, n, o, p
      Business: a
      Functional: b, c, d, j, k, l, m, n, o, p
      Non-functional: e, f, g, h, i
      Implementation: empty

problem 5.9 I like your additional requirements ~ shows you're thinking!

Good job on the assignment!  Keep it up...
