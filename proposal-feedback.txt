CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Diego Acosta and Eylul Akgul
Escape Keck game project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  Very complete and detailed.  I like the way
   you have it tell a story and at the same time seem like a sales pitch.  I
   think this will be a very useful project, too!  As you've seen during the
   time at LMU, we do a TON of group work here, and it is always a struggle
   to get the groups 'right'.  This is something that will carry over into
   the work world, too, so this is a VERY timely endeavor.

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Good job on the presentation, too.  I like the way you all had rehearsed
   your parts and knew what you were going to say, you talked to the people
   and not the slides, and you handled the questions well.


=============================================================================
your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
