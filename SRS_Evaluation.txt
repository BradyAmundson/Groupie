Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Pretty scant introduction, I don't really know what the software will *DO*
   from this description, but at least I know what the parts are.  By the
   way, when using acronyms like "ML" the customary style is to fully define
   the words first, and put the acronym in parens after it like:

      A Machine Learning (ML) Model to group people with .....

   You only do this the first time it's used, and then use the acronym every
   other time.

-- Functional Requirements
   Good start on this section!  In your introduction you mention a "game
   server" as well as supporting both game state and user information, but
   this application doesn't appear to be a game.  ???

   In 5.2.1.2, what exactly is a "clean" design?  Watch out for weasel words.
   The word "consistent" is fine, though.  Section 5.2.1.3 this one needs to
   have a "shall" in it.  Also, what is the description of a "classroom"?  I
   don't see an explanation of what that is.  In 5.2.1.4, what information
   is going to be stored?  For that matter, what requirements to you have to
   protect the users' information?  In 5.2.1.5, what will be on the survey?
   That information should be in a "will" statement [un-numbered] that is
   associated with the numbered shall statement.  In 5.2.1.8, this should be
   an un-numbered 'will' statement associated with requirement 5.2.1.7.

   In section 5.2.2, the requirements are all mis-numbered as 5.2.3.x.  Also,
   numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 need "shall" wording.  Number 2 should be two
   different requirements since storing and processing are two different
   operations.  In number 3, is the user data referenced here different than
   the 'authentication data' referenced in number 2?  If it is the same, you
   should keep it as a 'will', remove the number, and the language should be
   '...will include but not be limited to name, user ID, and enrolled class
   rooms.'  Number 4 should get the same kind of treatment.

   Section 5.2.3 the requirements are also mis-numbered.  These are all good
   requirements, although watch out for the word "and" in any requirements
   statement ~ that is normally an indication there should be two statements
   instead of one.

   All in all, not bad!  Try to 'tease out' at least another half a dozen
   requirements for each of the three sections.  Challenge yourselves to see
   how much detail you can think of from the standpoint of the users, either
   professors or students, like what questions will be on the survey, what
   data will be used to train the model, etc.

-- Performance Requirements
   Good specifications here, although where is section 5.3.2?

-- Environment Requirements
   Nice work on this section!  Just be careful of 'weasel words' like

=============================================================================
your score:  9% out of 10% which is an A-plus

All in all, not a bad first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.
Make the changes as suggested above, including several more requirements for
the second submission and you'll get the full 10% on this document.

=============================================================================
SECOND EVALUATION:

your score:  9% out of 10% which is an A-minus

I don't see any changes in your document, certainly none of the comments or
suggestions seem to have been incorporated...

Ah well... it's still in pretty good shape.
